# Chapter 7: Advanced Tactics - More Functions

## What You'll Learn
- Variable arguments (*args and **kwargs)
- Lambda functions (anonymous functions)
- Higher-order functions
- Recursion basics
- Advanced function techniques

## What You'll Build
- Dynamic ability system
- Special attack mechanics
- Flexible spell casting
- Recursive damage calculations

## Prerequisites
Complete Chapters 1-6 first

## Getting Started
1. Open the notebook: `notebooks/chapter_07_advanced_functions.ipynb`
2. Read through the story and examples
3. Complete the challenges
4. Check your answers with the tests

## Files
- `notebooks/chapter_07_advanced_functions.ipynb` - Main chapter content
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Need Help?
- Review the examples in the notebook
- Understand *args accepts any number of positional arguments
- Understand **kwargs accepts any number of keyword arguments
- Lambda functions are short anonymous functions
- Recursion needs a base case to stop
