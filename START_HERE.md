## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose Your Method)

### **Option A: Teach Locally (Recommended for Testing)**

```bash
# You're already here!
cd /Users/jwinter/projects/learn-python

# View all branches
git branch -a

# Test Chapter 1 student version
git checkout chapter-01-beginning
jupyter notebook notebooks/chapter_01_beginning.ipynb

# Test Chapter 1 solutions
git checkout chapter-01-solution
jupyter notebook notebooks/chapter_01_beginning.ipynb
```

### **Option B: Push to GitHub (Recommended for Distribution)**

```bash
# Create GitHub repository first (on github.com)
# Then:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-quest.git
git push -u origin --all

# Now students can:
# git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-quest.git
# git checkout chapter-01-beginning
```

### **Option C: Google Drive (Good for Chromebooks)**

1. Zip individual notebooks from each branch
2. Upload to Google Drive
3. Students download and upload to Google Colab
4. No git knowledge required!
