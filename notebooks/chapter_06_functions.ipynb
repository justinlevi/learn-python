    "She unrolls the scroll, revealing intricate patterns of code. \"Every time you face an enemy, you must calculate damage, heal wounds, and determine the outcome of battle. Would you want to write the same complicated calculations over and over again? Of course not! Functions let you write the spell once, then cast it as many times as needed. They're the foundation of all powerful magic... and all powerful code.\""
