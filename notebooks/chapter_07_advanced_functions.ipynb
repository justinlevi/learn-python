    "The merchant beams with pride as she sees you successfully casting spell after spell - your functions calculating damage, healing wounds, and managing battle outcomes with elegant precision. \"You've mastered the fundamentals of spell-crafting,\" she says, carefully shelving the basic scroll you've been studying. \"Your functions are clean, well-organized, and powerful. But there's so much more to learn!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "She pulls out an ornate chest from beneath the counter, its surface covered in swirling magical runes that seem to shift and change as you watch. \"These are the **advanced techniques** - the secret arts known only to master wizards of Pythonia.\" She opens the chest to reveal several glowing scrolls, each pulsing with different-colored energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"First,\" she says, holding up a scroll that splits into multiple streams of light, \"the art of **variable arguments** - spells that can accept any number of ingredients. Imagine a healing spell that works on one ally... or ten! Or a spell with properties you haven't even discovered yet.\" She sets it down and picks up a small, compact scroll. \"Then there are **lambda spells** - quick, one-time incantations for simple tasks. And finally,\" she holds up a scroll that seems to contain itself in an infinite loop, \"the mysterious art of **recursion** - spells that call upon themselves to solve problems in elegant ways.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Master these techniques,\" she continues, \"and you'll be able to create the most powerful and flexible ability systems imaginable. Your spells will adapt to any situation, your magic will scale with your power, and your code... well, your code will be truly legendary!\""

    "- **Variable arguments** with `*args` - spells that accept any number of ingredients\n",
    "- **Keyword arguments** with `**kwargs` - spells with flexible, named properties\n",
    "- **Lambda functions** - quick, one-time incantations for simple operations\n",
    "- **Higher-order functions** - spells that use other spells as components\n",
    "- **Recursion** - elegant self-referential magic for solving complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Your functions are now incredibly flexible and powerful. You can create ability systems that adapt to any situation, scale with any number of targets, and handle properties you haven't even thought of yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use These Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`*args`**: When you need to accept a variable number of similar items (multiple targets, multiple items, etc.)\n",
    "- **`**kwargs`**: When you need flexible, named parameters (ability properties, configuration options, etc.)\n",
    "- **Lambda**: For simple, one-time functions (sorting keys, filtering conditions, etc.)\n",
    "- **Higher-order functions**: When functions need to modify or enhance behavior of other functions\n",
    "- **Recursion**: When a problem naturally breaks into smaller versions of itself (trees, nested structures, mathematical sequences)\n",
